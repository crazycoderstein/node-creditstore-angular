### Important information about this hands-on workshop ###

This repository contains a tutorial that is non-workable anymore. On April 23, 2018 the limited availability of Managed Kubernetes inside Oracle Container Pipelines was shutdown and was moved to the new console. It made this tutorial non functional. If you need to have a look how this tutorial looked we still keeep archived copy of the tutorial [here](README_old.md)
